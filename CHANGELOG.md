# v0.5.0 (10/09/2026)

- Add batch import of services for all supported protocols from tab- or pipe-separated clipboard data, including
  explicit protocol schemes, default-port protocol inference, optional intervals, descriptions, groups, duplicate
  reporting, and IPv6 support by @dearmb (#24)
- Add editing of existing ping services from the service’s page, reusing the Add Ping Services dialog in edit mode for
  one or several selected services, applying the changes in place and rebuilding only the services whose protocol or
  address changed while keeping their list position by @dearmb (#25)
- Reject edits that would give a service the same protocol and address as another service, leaving the whole edit
  unapplied instead of creating a duplicate
- Add commands to toggle the enabled state of the selected service and of all services
- Add export of the replies of the selected service to tab-separated values, next to the existing CSV and JSON exports
- Add opening the response-time graph of every selected service in its own window
- Add keyboard shortcuts to the service’s page for adding, editing, pausing, resuming, toggling, resetting statistics,
  and opening graphs, and show the matching gesture on the context-menu entries
- Add a report tab on the dialog with app diagnostics
- Show the assigned hotkey in the tooltips of the added, resume all, pause all, and open-graph buttons
- Add data grid shortcuts to delete the selected rows and all rows, and to invert the selection, while leaving keys
  alone during cell editing
- Fix the macOS gestures of pause all and resume all colliding with pause selected and resume selected, and the resume
  all context-menu entry advertising the resume selected gesture

  resolution
- Fix TCP, UDP, and NTP hostname/port parsing, endpoint creation, address-family selection, and NTP default-port
  handling
- Fix UDP probes reporting success from a connectionless sending alone by waiting for a response from the remote service
- Fix HTTP replies using `0.0.0.0` after restoring reply history by resolving DNS independently of historical success
  counts and refreshing unresolved endpoints before HTTP requests
- Fix response-time charts handling timeouts and missing statistics, displaying reply history out of order, mixing
  average calculations, failing with an unlimited graph cache, and retaining stale data after statistics are reset
- Add configurable response-time graph sample windows, freeze/resume, automatic and full scaling, rolling averages,
  percentile, jitter, and displayed-window loss statistics
- Add multiservice response-time comparisons with minimum, average, current, maximum, failure status, host labels, and

  service-enablement toggles, with collapsible pop-out controls for probe interval and timeout and multiservice batch
  editing
- Add live reply-status summaries and replace disabled summary buttons with reusable, theme-aware status badges across
  the ping and network-interface views
- Optimize HTTP probes to complete after response headers and use the declared content length without downloading or
  buffering the response body
- Prevent slow services from delaying scheduled probes for other services while still blocking overlapping probes for
  the same service
- Enforce the configured reply-cache limit both while adding replies and after restoring resilient reply history
- Fix service-list parsing so protocol prefixes, HTTP/HTTPS URLs, descriptions, groups, intervals, timeouts, buffer
  sizes, and NTP entries are handled independently
- Cap configurable probe timeouts at 65,535 seconds and reuse unchanged ICMP `PingOptions`
- Reduce probe allocations with pooled UDP/NTP buffers and allocation-free elapsed-time measurements
- Keep pooled NTP request storage alive until asynchronous sends and response validation are complete
- Replace the custom `FastObservableCollection` and MintPlayer dependencies with synchronized ObservableCollections
  views
- Refactor shared provider metadata into a common model and consolidate the public NTP catalogue into `BaseProvider`

  refresh is disabled
- Dispose removed network-interface bridges and avoid constructing duplicate interface card controls
- Run automatic speed tests on the UI dispatcher and prevent cancellation from exposing a premature ready state
